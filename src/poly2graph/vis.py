    Draws the spectral graph over a given image.

    The function displays the image using a specified colormap and,

    to contract close nodes based on a threshold.

    Parameters:
        image (ArrayLike): The input image to be processed.
        ax (Optional[Any]): The matplotlib axis to use. If None, the current axis is used.
